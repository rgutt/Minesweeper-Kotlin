# Minesweeper-Kotlin
A simple terminal based Minesweeper game. At the beginning the user is asked for the total number of mines. In the next step the user needs to give a position of a point
on the lattice and claim if the point is either a mine or free. The game ends when there are no mines left or when the usere claims a mine as free.
